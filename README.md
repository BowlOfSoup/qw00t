Make sure you `cd` to `web/` first!

    npm install

To run a development build on port 8080: 

    npm run serve

To have a production build:

    npm run serve-production

#### Database
The initial project is set-up in a sqlite3 database, but you can use whatever database supported by [Doctrine](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal).

To make a Sqlite3 database work, you have to set the group of which the http-user (www-data/apache/http) is a member of to the database file.

    chgrp yourgroupname app/yourdatabasename.sqlite3
    chmod 775 app/yourdatabasename.sqlite3
    chgrp yourgroupname app
    chmod 775 app

Database schema follows.


#### API documentation
API documentation is made in [RAML](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec), converted to HTML with [raml2html](https://github.com/raml2html/raml2html).

To view API documentation, visit http://yourqw00turl/**doc**. To (re)generate the documentation run:
