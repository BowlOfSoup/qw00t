This project is still a work in progress! It aims to be a small quotes database, 
to be used internally in the company I work for.

#### Backend
API backend with Silex, simple custom API token authentication.

#### Frontend
Frontend follows. Prob. something with ReactJS.

#### Database
You'll need a sqlite3 database (qwoot.sqlite3 in the projects root). Details on that
follow later.

#### Get started
To install dependencies for the backend:

    composer install
